This project is an API for Tarpaulin, a course management tool similar to Canvas. Our API allows various operations on user, course, assignment, and submission information, including (but not limited to) course roster downloads, assignment submission creation, user data fetching, and course information fetching.

We relied on many technologies to create this API; some of these technologies are Node.js, Express, Docker, Reddis, GridFS, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
